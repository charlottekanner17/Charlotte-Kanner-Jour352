    <h1>Online platforms utilized for sextortion and coerce children into self-harm</h1>
    <h2>Popular online platforms like Discord are being used by predators to blackmail and degrade children into violent acts</h2>
    <h3>By Charlotte Kanner</h3>
    <p>The person in the online chat introduced himself as “Brad.” Using flattery and guile,
        he persuaded the 14-year-old girl to send a nude photo. It instantly became leverage. 
    <p>Over the following two weeks in April 2021, he and other online predators 
        threatened to send the image to the girl’s classmates in Oklahoma unless she 
        live-streamed degrading and violent acts, the girl’s mother told The Washington Post.</p>
 <p> They coerced her into carving their screen names deep into her thigh, drinking 
     from a toilet bowl and beheading a pet hamster — all as they watched in a video 
     chatroom on the social media platform Discord.</p>
    <p> The pressure escalated until she faced one final demand: to kill herself on camera.</p>
