    <h1>Online platforms utilized for sextortion are coercing children into self-harm</h1>
    <h2>Popular online platforms like Discord are being used by predators to blackmail and degrade children into violent acts</h2>
    <h3>By Charlotte Kanner</h3>
    <p>Unlike many “sextortion” schemes that seek money or increasingly graphic images, 
        these perpetrators are chasing notoriety in a community that glorifies cruelty, 
        victims and law enforcement officials say. The FBI issued a public warning in 
        September identifying eight such groups that target minors between the ages of 
        8 and 17, seeking to harm them for the members’ “own entertainment or their own 
        sense of fame.” <p>
    <p>“People are not understanding the severity, the speed at which their children 
        can become victimized,” she said. “These are offenders that have the ability 
        to change your child’s life in a matter of minutes.”</p>
